class ShotStatus(BaseModel):
    """
    A company-defined status a shot can be in (e.g. "Не начат", "В работе").

    Lives at the company level, not the project level - mirrors the
    plan already agreed for `TaskType` ("lives at the company level...
    so a project template can be created with a predefined set"). A
    studio's vocabulary for shot status is typically stable across its
    projects, and starting simpler here leaves room to add a
    project-level override layer later without reshaping this model.

    `order` is nullable and deliberately *not* unique - it's a sort key
    for the primary, ordered part of a studio's workflow (e.g. "Не
    начат" -> "Отдан"). Statuses with `order=None` are exception/side
    states (e.g. "Отмена", "На паузе") that the frontend renders after a
    separator, sorted some other way (name) rather than by workflow
    position - they deliberately don't participate in the main sequence.

    Exactly one status per company has `is_default=True` at a time -
    enforced in the API layer (setting a new default auto-unsets the
    old one), not a DB constraint, since nothing here is concurrent
    enough to need one. The default status can be deleted like any
    other - see `apps.shots.signals` for how a company starts out with
    a seeded set that includes one.

class Shot(BaseModel):
    """
    A single shot within a project.

    Belongs directly to a `Project` (not just transitively through its
    groups) because its name is unique at the project level, not the
    group level - a shot's identity doesn't depend on which group(s) it
    happens to be filed under.

    `groups` is a separate, optional, many-to-many concern: a shot can
    belong to zero, one, or several `ShotGroup`s of the same project
    simultaneously (membership in several groups is a deliberate, real
    use case, not an edge case to guard against). There's no "default"
    or "all" group auto-created for ungrouped shots - ungrouped is
    simply an empty `groups` set, and "every shot in this project" is
    already answered by filtering on `project` directly.

    Like `Project.code`, `name` is set once and never renamed - see
    spec-decisions on the public id scheme (`{project.code}_{shot.name}`).

    `status` is required - every shot always has one, defaulting to its
    company's `ShotStatus.is_default` at creation time if not specified
    explicitly (resolved in the API layer; see `apps.shots.api.views`).
    It uses `on_delete=PROTECT` rather than `SET_NULL`, since null isn't
    a valid state for this field - a status can't be deleted while any
    shot still uses it.
